When the content marketing manager is satisfied with the work of the online researcher, the content marketing manager asks the blog manager to fine tune the draft.
The blog manager delivers the final article.
When the content marketing manager is satisfied with the work of the blog manager, the content marketing manager asks the social media manager to write a tweet about the article.
The social media manager delivers the tweet.
When the content marketing manager is satisfied with the work of the social media manager, the content marketing manager ends the workflow.


### Take a look at LangSmith

### One important caveat: Multi-Agent Networks take time to deliver the final solution, so you will have to be patient.Â¶
Multi-Agent Networks, also called LLM Apps with Agentic Behavior or Multi-Agent LLM Apps take time, but their results are often better than the ones got from Non-Agentic LLM Apps.
